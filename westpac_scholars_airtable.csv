"I am a social worker by training. I got frustrated working in mental health because so many of the problems that I was trying to fix with individuals were actually systemic issues. I was also frustrated by being a gatekeeper to information about support options that really should have been public. At the same time, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was starting. The NDIS is using a market model to introduce competition and make the disability sector more effective. I realised that the issues with information would just get worse! I founded Clickability with my business partner Jenna. It's a website which allows people to rate and review the disability support services they use. They are using a community development approach to capacity-building with consumers and service providers, using the website as a hub.

I previously played a pivotal role in introducing life-changing telecommunication services for deaf and hard of hearing Australians. Today, I use my diverse experience in strategic planning, operations management and community engagement to oversee Happy Paws Happy Hearts and business partnerships for RSPCA Queensland. When I started Happy Paws Happy Hearts, I started witnessing two issues in need of a creative solution. Issue 1 - Hearts in Need: There are growing numbers of people disconnecting from society. For many, social interactions can become few and far between and getting out of a home, facility or hostel can be daunting. It is also difficult to find meaningful social experiences which restore self-confidence. Issue 2 - Paws in Need: There is increased demand on animal welfare shelters. The RSPCA need regular volunteers, particularly during work-hours. The more animal handling time rescue animals receive the better their behaviour and adoption prospects.

Growing up in Europe with dark olive skin, I was constantly in the sun, however I didn’t truly realise the power of UV rays until I moved to Australia in 2012 and found my skin was constantly sun burnt. Now I am working to develop low-cost, wearable technology such as a smart watch to enable Australians to easily monitor UV light exposure and prevent potentially fatal melanomas.
Australia has one of the highest UV ratings in the world with Melanoma accounting for more than 1,500 deaths and 12,500 cases per year. My research is at the forefront of using wearable nanosensors for melanoma prevention globally, leading the way for other countries which have not begun research in this area to develop innovative and vital solutions to skin protection from UV light.",2016,Thriving tech sector,1171,https://scholars.westpac.com.au/content/dam/public/wsch/images/2016/wsch_scholarhs_Antonio-Tricoli_480x480.jpg,,Antonio Tricoli,Research,Bacteria and viruses,Nano-technology,,,,Research Fellowship,New South Wales,The University of Sydney,2016,

"I am Sarah, mother of two amazing daughters and husband to a WA Police Detective. A school psychologist by trade, my life was turned upside down when my husband was diagnosed with workplace related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in 2008. Our marriage has been defined by his illness and the challenges that are associated with loving someone with a disease that changes every part of who they are.
 
Recovery is a long way off for us, and these last 8 years have seen me struggle to continue to support him in the face of what are often insurmountable obstacles. I realised that to honour the vow I made on my wedding day (to love in sickness and in health) I needed a network of support, understanding and education - imagine my surprise when I realised none existed, anywhere in Australia. In desperation I reached out on ABC radio for other people like me, and the floodgates opened. Hundreds of people contacted me after my interview wanting to reach out, to connect, to find solace.
 
And so, Alongside was born. 8 months later, I'm the CEO of a not-for-profit that operates across four states running proactive education, PTSD support and a strong sense of community for partners and families of Australia's frontline personnel across Defence and Emergency Services.
 
I've been blown away by the need out there. I used to think my family was the only one going through this, but it turns out there are hundreds. It makes me sad and humble and frustrated all at the same time. Using our hell on earth journey to bring about change for families exactly like ours has done a lot to make me feel like there was a reason our lives got thrown into chaos.

Samantha Nixon is a former arachnophobe turned venoms scientist and spider advocate. She is a final year PhD student at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, the University of Queensland and CSIRO Agriculture and Food. Her research harnesses the unique chemistries in spider venoms to make new medicines against the drug-resistant parasites of Australian sheep, which cost over $435 million each year. She now applies her discoveries to major human neglected tropical diseases, and coordinates an international team testing venoms against hookworms, blood-flukes, filarial worms and malaria – finding venoms active against every parasite tested so far.
 
Samantha is an avid explorer, working around the world from the Australian deserts, to the Amazon and even Antarctica as the youngest member of the 2018 all-women expedition to Antarctica with the Homeward Bound Leadership program. Samantha never imagined herself as a scientist—let alone of spiders—so she dedicates her time to science communication to help others get over their fear of spiders. Samantha’s work has been featured on children’s television (Channel 10’s Totally Wild and Scope), Channel 7 and 9, ABC Radio, The Conversation Curious Kids and in national and international print and digital media. She also travels to Queensland schools to share her work to help inspire the next-generation of Australian scientists.
 
Samantha has been recognised for her work with awards and grants from the Burroughs-Wellcome Trust, a 2019 National Geographic Women of Impact Earth Day Ambassador, the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, the International Society for Toxinology and the inaugural University of Queensland Global Change Scholar Award.",2017,Thriving tech sector,1230,https://scholars.westpac.com.au/content/dam/public/wsch/images/2017/wsch_scholarhs_Samantha-Nixon_480x480.jpg,,Samantha Nixon,Science communication ,Drug discovery,Parasitology,Venomous animals,Leadership,,Future Leaders,Queensland,The University of Queensland,2017,

"I’m an urban designer turned social entrepreneur who uses big data to measure the wellbeing of neighbourhoods. As co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer of Neighbourlytics - a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods - I’m redefining how we measure the success of cities. Since launching Neighbourlytics in 2017, we’ve created data for more than 500 neighbourhoods in cities across 10 countries and are influencing some of Australia’s most significant urban development decisions.
 
A leading global voice on urban innovation, I’ve been cited in Qantas Magazine and Vogue and been an invited keynote to companies such as Google, TEDx and UN-Habitat. I was named as one of Melbourne's 'Top 100' most influential people (The Age), and was recently awarded a Westpac Social Change Fellow and Myer Innovation Fellow.
 
This journey began for me 10 years ago when I was frustrated that the property sector focused its efforts on streets and buildings, rather than people and culture. Since then I’ve pioneered new approaches to shaping human-centered cities, that have been implemented around the world. This includes working with the United Nations where I contributed to Sustainable Development Goal 11 (cities) and my previous role as CEO and cofounder of Australia’s leading placemaking organisation CoDesign Studio where I oversaw the delivery of more than 100 neighbourhood improvement projects. A designer turned tech founder I am alumni of Singularity University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

 Kids in Australia shouldn't be missing out on food. Unfortunately, 1 in 8 Australian kids arrive at school hungry every day. When I read this statistic in my hometown's newspaper, The Shepparton News, I wanted to help.

 Teachers explain the issue best, they say ""when kids are hungry they can't concentrate, and when kids can't concentrate, they can't learn"".

"November 2nd 1999 was a life-changing day. While driving home from work running a major London ad agency, my car collided side on with an on-call fire engine. It left me with head injuries that mean I can’t balance or walk or talk as before (I’m a permanent wheelchair user, partially paralysed, with dramatic tremors, and severe speech, sight, and hearing impairments).
 
Since then I’ve dedicated my life to improving attitudes towards disabled people, and enhancing their experience: In 2005/6, I began sitting on UK panels on media portrayal, and soccer’s treatment of disabled people. I led by example, winning “UK Disabled Entrepreneur” 2007. And, after myself experiencing years of mistaken perceptions and assumptions, founded the charity, Diversability, to create more positive perceptions of disabled people.
 
My work continues here. I sit on disability advisory panels at City of Sydney and Central Coast Councils, and after years frustrated by being a couple with one of us in a wheelchair, my wife, Justine, and I founded WheelEasy, which fosters and creates better access to leisure activity for the mobility-impaired and their companions.

"I am first and foremost a mum to two beautiful girls, Faith and Rumi. Thanks to them, and to losing my mum, I have been driven to understand and change the postpartum experience in Australia. In 2018 I started The Village Foundation whilst completing my PhD, as a way to mobilize the research. I wanted to do more than write about it - I wanted to make a difference for every new family.
 
I completed my PhD in Psychology and Business and investigated social support in the postpartum period and the application of support structures in corporate and community Australia. Today The Village Foundation provides support and mentoring services, psychoeducational programs, and a mood-tracking App to parents within the community and corporate enterprises. I am currently a lead facilitator and content writer for several wellbeing and support programs.
 
Prior to this, I worked in the corporate sector including national operations management, workshop design and facilitation, team and event management, executive sales and marketing, retail and hospitality management, and corporate training. Recently, I was the Standards and Certification Director for Family Friendly Workplaces, in conjunction with national organization Parents at Work, and UNICEF Australia.
 
I am a very proud 2017 Westpac Future Leaders Scholar, and ex Co-Chair of the W100 - a role and network I completely adore and am so thrilled to be actively involved in again.

"Right now, thousands of Australian children are suffering and dying slowly with dementia, without access to the therapies and care they need, and most people are not aware that it exists. I am changing the discourse around childhood dementia by bringing the 70+ genetic conditions together under an umbrella of their common definition. This will drive systemic change for better care and quality of life for children with dementia and their families.
