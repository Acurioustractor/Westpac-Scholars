"I am a social worker by training. I got frustrated working in mental health because so many of the problems that I was trying to fix with individuals were actually systemic issues. I was also frustrated by being a gatekeeper to information about support options that really should have been public. At the same time, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was starting. The NDIS is using a market model to introduce competition and make the disability sector more effective. I realised that the issues with information would just get worse!

Today, I use my diverse experience in strategic planning, operations management and community engagement to oversee Happy Paws Happy Hearts and business partnerships for RSPCA Queensland. When I started Happy Paws Happy Hearts, I started witnessing two issues in need of a creative solution. Issue 1 - Hearts in Need: There are growing numbers of people disconnecting from society. For many, social interactions can become few and far between and getting out of a home, facility or hostel can be daunting. It is also difficult to find meaningful social experiences which restore self-confidence. Issue 2 - Paws in Need: There is increased demand on animal welfare shelters. The RSPCA need regular volunteers, particularly during work-hours. The more animal handling time rescue animals receive the better their behaviour and adoption prospects.

"My research focus is developing wearable nano-technology to help lower our nationâs risk of melanoma. Growing up in Europe with dark olive skin, I was constantly in the sun, however I didnât truly realise the power of UV rays until I moved to Australia in 2012 and found my skin was constantly sun burnt. Now I am working to develop low-cost, wearable technology such as a smart watch to enable Australians to easily monitor UV light exposure and prevent potentially fatal melanomas.
Australia has one of the highest UV ratings in the world with Melanoma accounting for more than 1,500 deaths and 12,500 cases per year. My research is at the forefront of using wearable nanosensors for melanoma prevention globally, leading the way for other countries which have not begun research in this area to develop innovative and vital solutions to skin protection from UV light.",2016,Thriving tech sector,1171,https://scholars.westpac.com.au/content/dam/public/wsch/images/2016/wsch_scholarhs_Antonio-Tricoli_480x480.jpg,,Antonio Tricoli,Research,Bacteria and viruses,Nano-technology,,,,Research Fellowship,New South Wales,The University of Sydney,2016,

"I am Sarah, mother of two amazing daughters and husband to a WA Police Detective. A school psychologist by trade, my life was turned upside down when my husband was diagnosed with workplace related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in 2008. Our marriage has been defined by his illness and the challenges that are associated with loving someone with a disease that changes every part of who they are.
Â 
Recovery is a long way off for us, and these last 8 years have seen me struggle to continue to support him in the face of what are often insurmountable obstacles. I realised that to honour the vow I made on my wedding day (to love in sickness and in health) I needed a network of support, understanding and education - imagine my surprise when I realised none existed, anywhere in Australia. In desperation I reached out on ABC radio for other people like me, and the floodgates opened. Hundreds of people contacted me after my interview wanting to reach out, to connect, to find solace.
Â 
And so, Alongside was born. 8 months later, I'm the CEO of a not-for-profit that operates across four states running proactive education, PTSD support and a strong sense of community for partners and families of Australia's frontline personnel across Defence and Emergency Services.

Samantha Nixon is a former arachnophobe turned venoms scientist and spider advocate.

Her research harnesses the unique chemistries in spider venoms to make new medicines against the drug-resistant parasites of Australian sheep, which cost over $435 million each year. She now applies her discoveries to major human neglected tropical diseases, and coordinates an international team testing venoms against hookworms, blood-flukes, filarial worms and malaria â finding venoms active against every parasite tested so far.

"Iâm an urban designer turned social entrepreneur who uses big data to measure the wellbeing of neighbourhoods. As co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer of Neighbourlytics - a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods - Iâm redefining how we measure the success of cities. Since launching Neighbourlytics in 2017, weâve created data for more than 500 neighbourhoods in cities across 10 countries and are influencing some of Australiaâs most significant urban development decisions.

This journey began for me 10 years ago when I was frustrated that the property sector focused its efforts on streets and buildings, rather than people and culture. Since then Iâve pioneered new approaches to shaping human-centered cities, that have been implemented around the world. This includes working with the United Nations where I contributed to Sustainable Development Goal 11 (cities) and my previous role as CEO and cofounder of Australiaâs leading placemaking organisation CoDesign Studio where I oversaw the delivery of more than 100 neighbourhood improvement projects.

There has been a lot of publicity about the possible negative impacts, which are real, but there is also real potential for games to provide positive outcomes for a wide range of people. Games can educate and inform people about important issues like sustainability. They can promote understanding of cultures, lifestyles, and varying abilities, thus promoting inclusion. They can engage and stimulate the brains of all ages from early learners through to the elderly. Games can also be an important driver of economic growth in Australiaâs cities and regions.
